TODO:
	- Pause command
	- The  shell  environment  should  containshell  =  <pathname>  /myshell 
	  where <pathname>/myshell  is  the  full  path  for  the  shell  executable 
	  (not  a  hardwired path back to your directory, but the one from which it 
	  was executed).
	- Built-in commands should be executed with an environment that contains the 
	  entry: parent = <pathname>/myshell where <pathname>/myshell is as described 
	  above.
